# Specification Quality Checklist: 001-home-task-list

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items pass. Specification is ready for `Plan` phase.
- Specification clearly defines:
  - User stories with priorities (P1: View task list, P2: Real-time distance updates)
  - Complete functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010)
  - Measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006)
  - Key entities (Task, Location)
  - Comprehensive edge case handling
  - Clear assumptions about mock data and location services
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are well-defined with reasonable defaults.
